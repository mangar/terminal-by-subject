TERMINAL BY SUBJECT
===================

This is a small particular project created to mix all Terminal.app that are suitable for differents porpoises.

It was a tip from Neal Ford when I was reading The Productive Programmer (must read)

For instance:

- Red Background for Ruby on Rails;
- Blue for Amazon Web Services.
